Create each question component - be verbose for now and then clean it up afterwards
Render out questions[0] - and follow the flowchart
If questions[0] = yes -> questions[1] -> answer question (note both score is zero) -> questions[2]
If questions[0] = no -> questions[2]
Questions[2] -> Questions[3]-> Questions[4] -> questions[5] -> all the way to questions[9]
questions[9] -> interface next different = max score / outcome
